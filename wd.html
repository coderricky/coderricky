                    exponentially. In the modern world, pretty much everyone has internet access of some form and a huge
                    percentage of people use the internet every single day. Web development is quickly becoming one of
                    the most attractive and best-paid career choices in the modern world. But what is a web developer
                    and what exactly does one do?</p>
                <p>You may have thought about learning a programming language or two and becoming a web developer.
                    Luckily for you, we understand that aspiring web developers will have questions about the
                    profession, which is why we have put together this comprehensive guide, which aims to answer the
                    above questions and more.</p>
                <p>We will look at the types of web developers, and we will look at the web design vs web development

                    of a Web Developer?</h2>
                <p>To answer the question “<i>What is a web developer?”</i>, we must first look at what a web developer
                    does and how they do it.</p>
                <p>A web developer or programmer is someone who takes a web design - which has been created by either a
                    client or a design team - and turns it into a website. They do this by writing lines and lines of
                    complicated code, using a variety of languages. Web developers have quite a difficult job, because
                    they essentially have to take a language we understand, such as English, and translate it into a
                    language that a computer understands, such as Python or HTML.</p>
                <p>As you can imagine, this can take a lot of time and effort and requires an intricate understanding of
                    various programming languages and how they are used. Different types of developers specialize in
                    different areas, which means that large web projects are usually a collaboration between several
                    different developers.</p>
                <h2 id="what-types-of-web-developers-are-there"><span class="copy-heading"></span>What Types Of Web
                    Developers Are There?</h2>
                <p>Unfortunately, the question “<i>What does a web developer do?”</i> doesn’t have one simple answer. As
                    noted above, there are some different types of web developers, each of which focuses on a different
                    aspect of the creation of a website.</p>
                <p>To understand what is a web developer it is crucial to know that the three main types of developers
                    are front-end, back-end, and full-stack. Front-end developers are responsible for the parts of a
                    website that people see and interact with, back-end developers are responsible for the behind the
                    scenes code that controls how a website loads and runs, and full-stack developers do a bit of
                    everything.</p>
                <h3 id="front-end-developer"><span class="copy-heading"></span>Front-End Developer</h3>
                <img src="fed.jpg" alt="fed" class="my-2">
                <p>A front-end developer is someone who takes a client or design team’s website design and writes the
                    code needed to implement it on the web. A decent front-end web developer will be fluent in at least
                    three programming languages - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>HTML allows them to add content to a website while splitting it into headings, paragraphs, and
                    tables. CSS lets a decent developer style the content and change things like colors, sizes, and
                    borders. JavaScript allows the inclusion of interactive elements, such as push buttons. We will go
                    into more detail about these languages later.</p>
                <p><strong>So, what do web developers do when they work on the front end of a website? </strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;">What is a web developer responsible for is that they make sure that
                        all of the content that is needed for the website is clear, visible, and found in the right
                        place. In some cases front-end developers may also have content writing skills, allowing them to
                        create the content for the website as they go.</li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;">They make sure that the right colors are in the right places,
                        especially concerning text colors, background colors, and headers. Some of the best front-end
                        developers are also very good designers, allowing them to tweak things as they go.</li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;">They make sure that all outbound links are correctly formatted, that
                        all buttons work properly, and that the website is responsive and attractive. Mobile design is
                        usually a big part of the job, while it is also important to make sure that a website will
                        display correctly on all web browsers.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>As you can see, the answer to the question <i>“What is a web developer?”</i> certainly isn’t simple.
                    Even front-end developers have it tough, and this is probably the simplest of the three types of
                    development to learn.</p>
                <p>If you want to become a front-end developer, though, head to our article, which can tell you the
                    secrets of becoming an entry level front-end developer.
                <h3 id="back-end-developer"><span class="copy-heading"></span>Back-End Developer</h3>
                <img src="bed.jpg" alt="bed" class="my-2">
                <p>While it may seem like front-end developers have a difficult job making sure that a website looks
                    great, works well, and contains the correct content, back-end developers have it much worse. While
                    front-end developers are responsible for client-side programming, back-end developers have to deal
                    with the server-side.</p>
                <p>This means that they have to create the code and programs which power the website’s server,
                    databases, and any applications that it contains. The most important thing as a <strong>back-end
                        developer</strong> is the ability to be able to create a clean, efficient code that does what
                    you want it to in the quickest way possible. Since website speed is a major consideration when it
                    comes to search engine optimization (SEO), it is a large factor when developing the back-end.</p>
                <p>To fully explain what is a web developer it is essential to know that back-end developers use a wide
                    range of different server-side languages to build complicated programs. Some of the most popular
                    languages used include PHP, Python, Java, and Ruby. JavaScript is also becoming increasingly
                    widespread as a back-end development language, while SQL is commonly used to manage and analyze data
                    in website databases.</p>
                <p>Since different websites have different needs, a back-end developer must be flexible, able to create
                    different programs, and they absolutely must have a clear, in-depth understanding of the languages
                    that they use. This is very important to make sure that they can come up with the most efficient
                    method of creating the required program while making sure that it is secure, scalable, and easy to
                    maintain.</p>
                <h3 id="full-stack-developer"><span class="copy-heading"></span>Full-Stack Developer</h3>
                <p>If you are looking for a quick, simple answer to the question “<i>What is a web developer?”</i>, then
                    a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> is probably the closest thing that you’re going to get.
                    Full-stack developers understand both front and back-end strategies and processes, which means that
                    they are perfectly positioned to oversee the entire process.</p>
                <p>In the case of small websites that don’t have a huge development budget, a full-stack developer will
                    often be employed to build the entire website. In this case, it is extremely important for them to
                    have a complete, in-depth understanding of both front and back-end development and how they work.
                </p>
                <p>Learning full-stack development techniques has a huge range of benefits, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;">You will end up with the knowledge to be able to create an entire
                        website on your own. This makes you a lot more employable, increasing your job security in the
                        future.</li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;">As a full-stack developer, you will understand the connections between
                        the front and back-ends of a website, allowing you do build efficient and effective programs for
                        all parts of the website.</li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;">Full-stack developers are often employed to oversee large projects for
                        big web development companies. Positions like this are likely to be paid more than standard web
                        development positions, making them more attractive to developers. Full-stack defines what is a
                        web developer.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although most developers start with either front or back-end specializations, there are a lot of
                    reasons why you should consider branching out and learning both. It will make you a lot more
                    employable, will give you a greater understanding of the whole concept of what is web development,
                    and will make it easier for you to create entire websites on your own.</p>
                <h2 id="how-to-be-a-web-developer"><span class="copy-heading"></span>How To Be A Web Developer</h2>
                <p>Now that we have started to answer the question of “<i>What is a web developer?”</i>, it’s time to
                    start looking at how to be a web developer. While a lot of people do their research, decide on
                    programming languages to learn, and have a good go at learning web development, the majority of them
                    fail due to a distinct lack of direction.</p>
                <p>If you are serious about building a career for yourself as an experienced web developer, then you
                    need to make sure that you start with a clear vision of how you are going to achieve this. The
                    following steps should help guide you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><i>Start by deciding what sort of developer you want to become.
                        </i>The languages and techniques that you learn will depend on whether you want to focus on
                        front or back-end development, to begin with.</li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Choose a decent course. </em>Next, you need to choose a course or
                        a couple of courses that will teach you the basics of web development. BitDegree offers many

                        sure that you set yourself realistic goals.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As you can see, it isn’t that hard to become a web developer. Sure, it will take a lot of time,
                    effort, and work, but you can do it if you want. Once you have come to a clear understanding of
                    ‘what is web development’ and ‘what does a web developer do’ it will only get easier.</p>
                <h2 id="web-design-vs-web-development"><span class="copy-heading"></span>Web Design vs Web Development
                </h2>
                <p>Now, we need to digress for a moment to address an important point that often comes up when people
                    start talking about web development - the web design vs web development debate. Are they different?
                    Are they the same thing?</p>
                <p>The answer is no, web design and web development are not the same, but of course, it depends on how
                    you define ‘design’ and ‘development’. For our article, we have assumed that it takes different
                    knowledge to understand what is a web designer and what is a web developer. These professions are
                    different and they have the following roles:</p>
                <p><i>Web Designer:</i></p>
                <p>The web designer is the person or group of people who are responsible for the creation of the website
                    concept. They might decide that it needs to be a certain color, with certain content and pages. They
                    may do things like creating infographics, logos, and videos, and they tell the developer where these
                    things have to be put on the web page. However, they don’t take part in the construction of the
                    website or the underlying code.</p>
                <p><i>Web Developer: </i></p>
                <p>The web developer takes the designer’s concepts and creates the code that is used to turn them into a
                    website and bring them to people like you and me. It is important to realize that, although the web
                    developer and the designer may be the same person - there is almost always some overlap between
                    design and front-end development - the roles are different.</p>
                <p>If you want to be a designer, you won’t necessarily have to learn any code at all. Likewise, a
                    developer doesn’t need to have any graphic design skills at all. From this, it follows that
                    ‘designing a website’ is not part of the answer to ‘<i>What is a web developer?’</i>.</p>
                <h2 id="popular-languages-for-web-development"><span class="copy-heading"></span>Popular Languages For
                    Web Development</h2>
                <img src="lag.png" alt="lag" width="100%">
                <p>Now, it is very important to realize that there is a range of different languages that are used for
                    web development. As noted above, front and back-end developers will need to learn different
                    languages, while full-stack developers will need a working knowledge of all the major web
                    development languages.</p>
                <p>With this in mind, we have put together a list of some of the most common languages for web
                    developers to learn, along with an explanation of what they are used for and how you can learn them.
                </p>
                <h3 id="html" class="text-primary"><span class="copy-heading"></span>HTML</h3>
                <p>HTML is an essential language if you want to understand what is a web developer and how to become a
                    front-end one. To explain it fully, I need you to do something for me:</p>
                <p><i>Right-click on your browser window, and select ‘view page source’. </i></p>
                <p>You should be taken to a new tab containing all of the information which goes into the creation of
                    this webpage. What you are seeing is mainly HTML code. It tells the website what content to display
                    and to some extent, how to display it. At the top of the page, on the first line, you will see the
                    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; command. This tells your web browser to expect HTML code.</p>
                <p>If you explore further, you will start to recognize things on the page. You will see some commands
                    that you understand, such as ‘link’, ‘image’, or ‘video’. These are all content commands which tell
                    your browser what to show, where to get the content from, and how to show it.</p>
                <p>HTML is a very easy language to learn, and it is usually the first one learned by new programmers. If
                    you are interested in exploring HTML, having a deeper look at what is a web developer, and front-end
                    web development, consider enrolling in the <strong>HTML Coding for Beginners Course</strong> or the
                    <strong>Comprehensive HTML5 Tutorial</strong>.</p>
                <h3 id="css" class="text-danger"><span class="copy-heading"></span>CSS</h3>
                <p>CSS is the second of the essential front-end languages and is also one which every front-end
                    developer must be fluent in. The CSS code is used in conjunction with HTML. While HTML tells the
                    webpage what content to display, CSS tells the webpage how to display the content - it’s a ‘styling’
                    language.</p>
                <p>Once you have learned CSS, you will be able to do a wide range of things, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><i>Changing colors. CSS allows you to change the color of pretty much
                            everything from your paragraph text to your background to your table borders. </i></li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Changing fonts. CSS also lets you choose the fonts that you are
                            going to use on your website and where you are going to use them. </em></li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Positioning elements. One of the key elements of what is a web
                            developer capable to do is arranging everything you see in the website. HTML lets you add
                            images and videos to your webpage, but CSS lets you tell the browser how big to make them
                            and where to display them. </em></li>
                    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Changing text size. Are you building a website designed for people
                            with poor eyesight? If so, you will need to use your knowledge of CSS coding to make your
                            text larger. </em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>As you can see, CSS plays a big role in web development, especially to front-end developers.</p>
                <p>If you would like to learn CSS, try the <a>CSS Coding for Beginners course</a>, which will teach
                    you the basics of CSS in under an hour. Alternatively, try <a target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Interactive Coding for Beginners</a>, which will give you an insight
                    into the basics of HTML, CSS, and responsive web development.</p>
                <h3 id="javascript" class="text-warning"><span class="copy-heading"></span>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>What do web developers do? Well, most web developers take a programming language like Java or HTML
                    and use it to create a component of a website. JavaScript developers are no different, except they
                    create very specific content. So, for JavaScript, what is a web developer exactly?</p>
                <p>Most JavaScript developers work on the front-end of a website. They build small snippets of
                    JavaScript code that make your website responsive, interactive, and attractive to your visitors.
                    These JavaScript snippets are often embedded in the HTML source code for a website.</p>
                <p>Although it has traditionally been a front-end language, and one which is vital for any front-end
                    developer to learn, JavaScript is becoming increasingly popular for back-end development as well. A
                    lot of front-end developers are beginning to find work as full-stack developers due to their
                    knowledge of JavaScript, which means that its usage and popularity is skyrocketing.</p>
                <p>BitDegree offers two separate JavaScript tutorials. The first, <a target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">A Video JavaScript Tutorial</a>, will teach you the basics of the
                    language and how it is used in just over an hour of video lectures. The second, the <a
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interactive JavaScript Tutorial</a>, will go into more
                    depth about
                    JavaScript uses, syntax, and functions.</p>
                <h3 id="php" class="text-success"><span class="copy-heading"></span>PHP</h3>
                <p>Historically, PHP has dominated definitions of what is a web developer. Known as the language of the
                    internet, it is currently used in some form on over 80% of websites in existence. Although it is
                    slowly decreasing in popularity, PHP is still a great language for any back-end web developer to
                    learn.</p>
                <p>PHP is very easy to learn and is quite easy to use, which makes it very popular for beginner back-end
                    developers. It is very popular on small websites built on platforms like WordPress or Wix, and there
                    are plenty of freelance work opportunities for PHP developers.</p>
                <p>If this sparks your interest, consider taking an online PHP course. Note that it is very important to
                    take an up to date course, like those offered by BitDegree, as older versions of the language are
                    quite different from the modern version (PHP7).</p>
                <p>BitDegree offers various PHP courses: starting from the <a target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn PHP Online tutorial</a> going all the way to <a>practical PHP
                        &amp; MySQL course</a> that will
                    give you 5 projects to complete. Take a look at both of these (and others) and choose the one which
                    you think is most relevant to your desired career path.</p>
                <h3 id="java" class="text-info"><span class="copy-heading"></span>Java</h3>
                <p>The last of the languages on our list, Java, has been a major part of what is a web developer for
                    years. It is an old language and is popular for a variety of different programming uses. From a web
                    development sense, Java is used to create responsive, scalable web apps that are used for
                    responsive, fast website design.</p>
                <p>Java is an essential language for many back-end developers. It is quite easy to learn, which makes it
                    beginner-friendly, and it is very easy to use. It is super scalable, which makes it popular among
                    larger websites like eBay and Amazon, and it is very easy to maintain.</p>
                <p>If you would like to have a go at learning Java, have a look at the <a target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">interactive Java course</a>. This course will teach you the basics of
                    how to code with Java, what Java is used for, and how to build server-side (back-end) programs.</p>
