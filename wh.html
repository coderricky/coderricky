            <div class="heading">What is Web Hosting?</div>
            Web hosting is a service that allows organizations and individuals to post a website or web page onto the
            Internet. A web host, or
            web hosting service provider, is a business that provides the technologies and services needed for the
            website or webpage to be
            viewed in the Internet. Websites are hosted, or stored, on special computers called servers. When Internet
            users want to view
            your website, all they need to do is type your website address or domain into their browser. Their computer
            will then connect
            to your server and your webpages will be delivered to them through the browser.
            <br><br>
            Most hosting companies require that you own your domain in order to host with them. If you do not have a
            domain, the hosting
            companies will help you purchase one.

            <div class="begContentSubHeading">Here are some features you should be expecting from your hosting provider:
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                <table class="begContentText" width="100%">
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td valign="top" width="20%">Email Accounts</td>
                            <td width="80%">
                                As mentioned earlier, most hosting providers require users to have their own domain
                                name.
                                With a domain name (e.g. www.yourwebsite.com) and email account features provided by
                                your hosting
                                company, you can create domain email accounts (e.g. yourname@yourwebsite.com).
                                <br><br>
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td valign="top">FTP Access</td>
                            <td>
                                The use of FTP lets you upload files from your local computer to your web server. If you
                                build your
                                website using your own HTML files, you can transfer the files from your computer to the
                                web server
                                through FTP, allowing your website to be accessed through the internet.
                                <br><br>
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td valign="top">WordPress Support</td>
                            <td>
                                WordPress is an online website creation tool. It is a powerful blogging and website
                                content management
                                system, which is a convenient way to create and manage website. WordPress powers over
                                25% of websites
                                on the internet. Most hosting providers will tell you right away if their plans are
                                WordPress-compatible
                                or not. The simple requirements for hosting your WordPress websites include: PHP version
                                7 or greater;
                                MySQL version 5.6 or greater.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            If you decide to create and host your website with Website.com, in addition to access to the drag and drop
            site builder,
            you can get a custom domain, email addresses, and web hosting all bundled into one subscription.
            <br><br>
            An advantage of using a website builder is that it allows you to simply drag and drop content to create your
            site, and publish your site to live with a few clicks.
            No technical experience is required. With the Website.com site builder, you will not need to build your
            website with coding, and you will not need to transfer
            files from your desktop computer to the server through FTP.
            <br><br>
            If you would rather build your website through coding or a CMS tool like WordPress, we've handpicked a few
            hosting
            providers based on their features and price:

            <br>
            <div class="begContentSubHeading">How can my online business benefit from a web hosting service?</div>
            <div>
                In order to publish your website online, your business website requires a web hosting service. However,
                a web host gives business owners
                more than just web hosting services! For example, web hosting firms typically employ in-house
                technicians to make sure their clients' websites
                are up and running 24/7. Plus, when website owners are in need of help or troubleshooting (e.g. script
                debutting, email not able to send/receive,
                domain name renewal, and more), the web host's in-house support are the go-to people. A professional web
                hosting service ensures a hassle-free
                experience for business owners, so they can efficiently focus their time and effort on their businesses.
